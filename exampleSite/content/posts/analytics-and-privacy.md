Analytics is off until you turn it on, and no third-party request is made
otherwise. `hugo server` never loads analytics either, so previewing your site
does not pollute your own stats.

## Turning it on

Uncomment the block for the service you use and paste your ID in. That is the
whole setup — there is nothing to change in the templates.

```toml
[params.analytics]
  # Google Analytics 4
  # [params.analytics.google]
  #   id = "G-XXXXXXXXXX"

  # Plausible - cookieless, so no consent banner needed
  # [params.analytics.plausible]
  #   domain = "yourdomain.com"
```

The `[params.analytics]` header stays in place so you only need to remove the
`#` from the two lines underneath it.

**Google Analytics 4** loads the standard `gtag.js` snippet. Leave the ID as
`G-XXXXXXXXXX` and nothing is emitted, so the placeholder is safe to leave.

**Plausible** takes a domain and loads the script from
`https://plausible.io/js/script.js`. If you self-host, point `script_url`
somewhere else.

## Something else entirely

A self-hosted counter, a verification tag, a webring script — anything goes in
as raw HTML:

```toml
  [params.analytics.custom]
    head   = "<script>...</script>"
    footer = "<script>...</script>"
```

## Privacy switches

```toml
[params.privacy]
  disableAnalytics      = false
  disableAnalyticsLocal = true
  anonymizeIP           = true
```

- `disableAnalytics` is the global kill switch. Set it true and nothing loads
  even if an ID is configured.
- `disableAnalyticsLocal` is the reason your development visits stay out of
  your stats. It defaults to true.
- `anonymizeIP` applies to the Google Analytics config call.

## A webring, if you want one

```toml
  [params.analytics.webring]
    enable = true
    name   = "The Retro Ring"
    prev   = "https://example.org/prev/"
    next   = "https://example.org/next/"
    random = "https://example.org/random/"
    list   = "https://example.org/ring/"
```

Renders a small terminal-styled navigator above the footer. Entirely optional,
and off unless enabled.
