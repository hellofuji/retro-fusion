## Set your domain first

```toml
baseURL = "https://yourdomain.com/"
```

This is the one setting that genuinely matters. It feeds canonical URLs, the
sitemap, Open Graph tags and the RSS feed. Leave a placeholder there and you
are telling search engines your site is a duplicate of a domain you do not own.

Keep the trailing slash.

## Build

```bash
hugo
```

Output lands in `public/`. There is no build step beyond this — no npm, no
asset pipeline, no post-processing. The folder is a plain static site.

To check it locally the way a host will serve it:

```bash
hugo && cd public && python3 -m http.server 8000
```

## Hosting

Anywhere that serves files. Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, S3, or a
directory on a web server you already have.

The usual settings:

| | |
|---|---|
| Build command | `hugo` |
| Publish directory | `public` |

If your host builds from a git repository, remember the theme needs to be there
too — a submodule has to be initialised in the build step:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive && hugo
```

## Before you publish

- `baseURL` set to your real domain
- `title`, `description` and `author` filled in
- Demo content deleted, or at least unpublished
- `enableRobotsTXT = true` if you want a `robots.txt`
- Analytics uncommented only if you actually want it
