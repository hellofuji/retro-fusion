Retro Fusion is inspired by early web culture — the period when a page was a
document, a site was somebody's project, and nobody had yet worked out that you
could put an advertisement between two paragraphs.

The look borrows from that era: beveled borders, tiled backgrounds, window
chrome, high contrast. The engineering does not. Underneath is semantic HTML5,
CSS Grid, fluid type and a small script that only ever enhances what already
works.

## Things that are missing on purpose

If a feature you expected is not here, it was probably left out rather than
forgotten.

**No shortcodes.** Nothing to learn beyond Markdown and front matter.

**No comment system.** A blog without comments is a blog. If you want them,
wire up a service you control.

**No contact form.** A form that silently drops submissions is worse than an
email address.

**No search.** It needs either a service or a build-time index, and both are
more machinery than a small site justifies. There is a `searchURL` setting if
you want to point at your own.

**No cookie banner.** The theme sets no cookies and makes no third-party
requests, so there is nothing to consent to. That changes the moment you add
analytics — which is why it is off by default.

**No dark mode toggle.** The palette is a config value. Set it to something
dark and you have dark mode.

## Things it does keep

**It works without JavaScript.** With the script blocked, the site still
navigates, the carousel still scrolls, the FAQ still opens, and the visitor
counter still shows a server-rendered number. Nothing below the fold depends on
the script running.

**It respects system settings.** Reduced-motion turns off the marquee, the
blink, the smooth scrolling and the carousel autoplay. High-contrast mode is
handled explicitly.

**It makes no third-party requests.** No fonts, no icon library, no CDN. The
stylesheet, the script and every icon are served from your own domain.

**It is short.** One stylesheet with a numbered table of contents, one script,
and templates that are meant to be read and copied.

## What that costs you

The theme will not do everything. It has no page builder, no component library
and no plugin system, and it is not going to grow one. If you need something it
does not have, the honest answer is to copy one of its templates into your own
`layouts/` directory and change it — that is what the small file sizes are for.
